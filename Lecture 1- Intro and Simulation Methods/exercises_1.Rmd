1. Let's start by writing a function that generates fake data 

$$
y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i1} + \beta_2 x_{i2} + e_i
$$

```{r}
generate_sample<- function(n_obs, beta, x1_var,x2_var,e_var,e_type){
  return 
}
```

The function should take the following arguments:

  * n_obs: number of observations in the sample
  * beta : a vector of coefficients
  * x1_var: a variance/scale parameter for x1
  * x2_var: a variance/scale parameter for x2
  * e_var: a variance/scale parameter for e_i
  * e_type: a distribution type for the residual (maybe uniform or normal?)
 
2. Now let's write a function that takes the same arguments and also takes as an argument the number of simulated datasets (say 1000?)

3. Let's write a function that takes in a single dataset and runs a regression and calculates the output (let's keep the estimates of $\widehat{\beta}$ and it's standard error, $R^2$, $MSE$, and let's evaluate the a t-statistic for the hypothesis that $H_0: \beta=a$ for some choice of $a$). It will be helpful to return everything in a data frame.

4. Plot the distribution of $\widehat{\beta}_1$ when the sample size is $n=100$ and see how it compares when $e_i$ is uniform vs. when it is normal across the 1000 samples.

5. Make a table that shows how $\widehat{\beta}_1$ and computes the mean, the standard deviation, the 5th and 95th percentile, and compare that to the asymptotic standard error under different assumptions about the error distribution.

6. How does changing the variance of $x_1$ and $x_2$ and $e_i$ affect the results? Can you provide a relative precise quantification?
